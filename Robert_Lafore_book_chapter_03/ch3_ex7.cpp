    //  Write a program that calculates how much money youâ€™ll end up with if you invest an
    //  amount of money at a fixed interest rate, compounded yearly. Have the user furnish the
    //  initial amount, the number of years, and the yearly interest rate in percent. Some interac
    //  tion with the program might look like this:
    //  Enter initial amount: 3000
    //  Enter number of years: 10
    //  Enter interest rate (percent per year): 5.5
    //  At the end of 10 years, you will have 5124.43 dollars.

    //  At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end of
    //  the second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as many
    //  times as there are years. A for loop makes the calculation easy.
