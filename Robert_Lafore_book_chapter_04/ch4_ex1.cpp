    //  A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the
    //  area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a program that uses a
    //  structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure
    //  phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user
    //  input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers. The interchange might
    //  look like this:
    //  Enter your area code, exchange, and number: 415 555 1212
    //  My number is (212) 767-8900
    //  Your number is (415) 555-1212
